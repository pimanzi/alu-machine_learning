    """
    Calculate the intersection of obtaining observed
    data with various hypothetical probabilities
    of developing severe side effects in a drug trial.

    This function uses the binomial distribution to
    model the probability of observing
    a certain number of patients with severe side
    effects given different probabilities
    of side effect occurrence, and combines this with prior beliefs.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    x : int
        The number of patients that develop severe side effects.
    n : int
        The total number of patients observed in the trial.
    P : numpy.ndarray
        A 1D array containing various hypothetical probabilities
        of developing severe side effects.
    Pr : numpy.ndarray
        A 1D array containing the prior beliefs of P.

    Returns:
    --------
    numpy.ndarray
        A 1D array containing the intersection of obtaining x
        and n with each probability in P.

    Raises:
    -------
    ValueError
        If n is not a positive integer.
        If x is not a non-negative integer.
        If x is greater than n.
        If any value in P or Pr is not in the range [0, 1].
        If Pr does not sum to 1.
    TypeError
        If P is not a 1D numpy.ndarray.
        If Pr is not a numpy.ndarray with the same shape as P.
