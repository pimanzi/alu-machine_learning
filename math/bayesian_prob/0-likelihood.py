def likelihood(x, n, P):
    """
     Calculate the likelihood of obtaining observed data for
     various hypothetical probabilities
    of developing severe side effects in a drug trial.

    This function uses the binomial distribution to model
    the probability of observing
    a certain number of patients with severe side effects
    given different probabilities
    of side effect occurrence.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    x : int
        The number of patients that develop severe side effects.
    n : int
        The total number of patients observed in the trial.
    P : numpy.ndarray
        A 1D array containing various hypothetical probabilities of
            developing severe side effects.

    Returns:
    --------
    numpy.ndarray
        A 1D array containing the likelihood of obtaining
        the observed data (x out of n)
        for each probability in P, respectively.
